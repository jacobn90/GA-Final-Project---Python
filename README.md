Summer Social Distancing - NYC (Data Science)

With the onset of the devastating effects of Covid-19 on our daily lives and wellbeing, it is becoming increasingly important to spend time outside. The density of New York City presents a serious challenge in mediating between this goal and the pandemic. This, along with the predictable discomfort of the summer heat, was the main impetus for this project.

The Summer Social Distancing tool will allow the audience to gain insight into which sidewalks are best for social distancing (width dimensions) and access to shade by using tree location data. The values of social_distancing_comfort (based on a scoring system of sidewalk widths) annd tree_density (density per sq.ft), will be used to determine the best locations for cool and safe summer walks. The user will be able to acquire information about which boroughs, neighborhoods, spaces, and tree species are best for pedestrians in times of quarantine or non-quarantine in New York City.
