Summer Social Distancing - NYC (Data Science)

With the onset of the devastating effects of Covid-19 on our daily lives and wellbeing, it is becoming increasingly important to spend time outside. The density of New York City presents a serious challenge in mediating between this fact and the pandemic. This, along with the predictable discomfort due to summer heat, was the main impetus for this project.

The Summer Social Distancing tool will allow the audience to gain insight into which sidewalks are best for social distancing (width dimensions) and the access to shade by using tree location data. An overall score, which consists of adding the values of sidewalk width (based on a scoring system) to frequency of trees, will be used to determine the best locations for cool and safe summer walks. The user will be able to acquire information about which boroughs, neighborhoods, spaces, and tree species are best for pedestrians in times of social-distancing in New York City.
